_label_negation mali 
_label_negation No it has to have a Mac that runs on power pc not Intel processors
_label_negation No because it's not a listening course. It really is something you must read and take notes on so in this case, for the purpose that you're looking for, this product would not suit. However, I can suggest something for you that you may also buy on Amazon. Even though Human Japanese is an AWESOME learning tool, if you're wanting to play something in your sleep to help you tune in to the way a native speaker talks, buy yourself a book called Read Real Japanese. There is an audio CD that comes with this book wherein the stories are read. You can get a real good sense of speech speed as well as start getting used to picking out words you know. it's a great sleep tool because it's interesting enough without being droning lessons and you'll start to feel yourself compelled to pick apart the speech and translations. So both products are good but Read Real Japanese is the one I'd recommend for the purposes you're aiming for and keep Human Japanese for the thing you tinker with on weekends between classes or get it on your kindle so you can read through it on the go.
